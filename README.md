# Etch-a-Sketch Project

## Project Description

This project is a browser version of a toy combining a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Itâ€™s designed to practice DOM manipulation and Flexbox skills. The project involves creating a grid of divs that change color on hover, creating a drawing effect.

## Features

- Create a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript.
- Use Flexbox to display the divs as a grid.
- Implement a hover effect to change the color of the divs when the mouse passes over them.
- Add a button to prompt the user for the number of squares per side for a new grid.
- Dynamically resize the grid without changing the total pixel dimensions.
- Implement a reset button to clear the grid and start a new game.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- JavaScript

## Extra Challenges

1. Randomize the RGB values of the squares on each interaction.
2. Implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%.
